#CS231n Assignments

This repository contains my ongoing solutions of the assignments for Stanford's CS231n class named "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition", which was offered in Winter 2016.

More information about the course can be found [here](http://cs231n.github.io).

Note: the datasets are not included in this repository. If you're interested in obtaining them, run the corresponding script (e.g. `assignment1/cs231n/datasets/get_datasets.sh`).
